- models.js  
  Defines the Student class with immutable IDs using Object.defineProperty.

- database.js  
  Simulates an asynchronous database call using setTimeout and callbacks.

- analytics.js  
  Contains helper functions for calculating averages, finding the top student,
  and filtering students using higher-order functions.

- main.js  
  Entry point that connects everything together and produces console output.

  The only hard parts were "Ensuring immutability of the student ID using (Object.define Property)" and "Combining array methods (map, filter, reduce) for analytics logic" I tried new git upload method but it messed up my previous project adding other folders as well so i had to make new repository.
